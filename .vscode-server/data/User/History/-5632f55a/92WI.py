# 1. Preprocess the Data
# Read PCAPNG file and extract features using scapy
pcap = rdpcap("network_traffic.pcapng")

# Extract relevant features from the packets
# Example: Extract source IP, destination IP, protocol, length, etc.

# Convert the extracted features into a DataFrame
data = pd.DataFrame(features, columns=["src_ip", "dst_ip", "protocol", "length"])

# 2. Feature Engineering
# Engineer additional features if needed

# 3. Labeling
# Ensure your data has appropriate labels for training

# 4. Train a Machine Learning Model
# Proceed with training the model as before
